# The Prisoner Problem Simulation
The R code implements the solution to the escape of 2n prisoners through probability and combinations. The prisoners must find their number in one of the 2n boxes, while they may open only n number of boxes. The rule states they cannot communicate with each other. All the prisoners must succeed in order to escape.
